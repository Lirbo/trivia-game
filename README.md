# Trivia Game

A small trivia game created as a course assignment.

## Installation

- Open `database.py` and adjust the database connection credentials if needed.  
  - **Note:** Thereâ€™s no need to change `DB_NAME`. The database `trivia` will be created automatically on first run.


- Run `main.py`.  
  - On the first run, you may see a warning that the `trivia` database is not found; this is expected as it will be created automatically.


- Log in as an admin using the credentials:  
```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```


- Click **Create a Question** to add new questions (create at least 2).

- Log out from the admin account.
  
- Create a new user account to play, view your stats, and check the Hall of Fame.

- To view game statistics, log back into the admin account after playing on multiple user accounts.
